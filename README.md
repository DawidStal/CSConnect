# CSConnect
CSConnect was a university group project that I participated in as part of a 7-person team. My main responsibilities included integrating React with Firebase and ensuring the interaction between the two.

CSConnect is a social networking platform designed for Computer Science students to connect, share knowledge, and collaborate. The platform fosters community-building by providing features like posts, announcements, messaging, and academic resources, all within an intuitive and seamless user experience.

## Features
- <b>User Interaction:</b> Posts, messages, and module-specific updates.
- <b>Collaboration:</b> Private messaging, discussion boards, and announcements for academic events.
- <b>Networking:</b> Connect with peers and stay informed about modules and university activities.
## Technologies Used
### Frontend
- <b>React.js:</b> Utilized for efficient, component-based user interface development, enabling fast, dynamic page updates.
- <b>CSS:</b> Custom styling and media queries for a responsive, mobile-friendly design.
- <b>React Context API:</b> Efficient state management across components without complex libraries.
### Backend
- <b>Firebase Firestore:</b> A NoSQL database for real-time data synchronization and scalable data handling.
- <b>Firebase Authentication:</b> Secure and flexible user authentication for seamless sign-ups, logins, and session management.
### Version Control
- <b>Git & GitLab:</b> Used for feature branching, peer reviews, and ensuring code quality through structured workflows.
## Database Design
- <b>Firestore Collections:</b> Includes Users, Modules, Posts, and Messages, organized for fast, scalable access.
- <b>User-Centric Design:</b> Intuitive navigation, clear UI elements, and a modern aesthetic focused on functionality and accessibility.
- <b>Testing:</b> Extensive testing of interactions and real-time data to ensure smooth operation and bug-free user experience.
## Challenges
- <b>Learning Firebase Integration:</b> Overcoming the learning curve of Firebase Authentication and Firestore for real-time data management. 
- <b>React.js State Management:</b> Addressing challenges in managing state and React lifecycle methods.
## Summary
CSConnect combines React.js for front-end development, Firebase Firestore for the backend. The platform is built to be scalable, secure, and user-friendly, providing a community-driven space for Computer Science students to engage and collaborate.
